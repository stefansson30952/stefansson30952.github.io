      </h2>
      <p class="about">
        I am a second year Computer Engineering Student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). 
        Since starting my program, I’ve constantly been programming and am always eager to learn more. 
        An aspect of Computer Engineering that I enjoy is teamwork. With this, I can learn from different perspectives, include a variety of ideas in a project, and come to a solution more efficiently. 
        This summer, I am looking for a 4 or 8 month Co-op term starting in May, 2020, in any field related in computer engineering. 
        Some of my programming skills include Java, Verilog, HTML, CSS, and C++.

            I’ve been fortunate to work for Wize Inc, an online exam and tutoring company, for the past few months. 
            This job opportunity has allowed me to develop my problem solving, critical thinking and customer service skills. 
            As a content creator, I develop mock university-level exams to assist students with the content they’re learning in class. 
            By working backwards and identifying common areas where students struggle, I develop the new exam questions to allow customers to understand key concepts and improve their exam results.

          <h4>

          <p>
            Throughout this year, I was fortunate to be working on the UBC Sailbot engineering design team. 
            As a design team, our goal is to build an autonomous sailboat and to compete in the Vic-Maui Race, sailing from Victoria, Canada to Maui, Hawaii. 
            With the competition approaching quickly, it was important that I completed my work on time for my team. 
            Once I finished the boom positioning sensor, I volunteered to build the hull to ensure our boat is ready for the race. 
            Sailbot has given me hands on experience with a developing project, and an opportunity to work towards a common goal with a team.

          <h3>Wikipedia API project</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            During the first term of my second year, a partner and I developed a program that interacted with application programming interface (API) while communicating with Wikipedia. With this project, I compiled six different methods using the API to collect information from Wikipedia. 
            With these codes, we could collect text on a page, information from related pages and record each command entered into the program. 
            With this knowledge, I was able to write a program to complete the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikiracing">Wikiracing</a> game. 
            The goal of this game is to pick a start and end page and find the quickest way to go between the pages. 
            After developing the code, the program was able to self-determine a pathway from the start page to the end page to complete the challenge of the game.

          <h3>Graph and Kamino Game Project</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Another project I developed with a partner was a programmed Graph Abstract Data Type (ADT) in Java. 
            In our Graph ADT, we programmed several operations to create the graph including: adding or removing vertexes and adding or removing edges between vertexes. 
            Next, using Dijkstra’s algorithm, I programmed a function to find the shortest path from one vertex to another. 
            After programming each operation, I extensively tested the code in Junit. 
            I tested every possible case to ensure 100% branch and line coverage.

          <h3>Reduced Instruction Set Chip Design Project</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Lastly, a partner and I created another project with a Reduce Instruction Set Chip (RISC) in Verilog. 
            In our RISC, we used a state machine to read instructions from a read-write memory block. 
            The instructions were executed by the program, and included moving numbers into registers, adding and subtracting numbers, comparing two numbers, loading and storing values into memory and various branch operations. 
            In addition, we thoroughly tested the operations and our code in testbenches.

          <h3>University of British Columbia</h3>
          <h4>

          <p>
            Since attending The University of British Columbia (UBC), I’ve been fortunate to receive something no other institution or opportunity has given me; growth and personal development. 
            For the two years I’ve been at UBC, I have had access to amazing professors that challenged me and expanded my world view, which has ultimately pushed me into computer engineering. 
            My time with UBC Sailbot showed me the power of working in a team, the importance of good leadership and how critical it is to solve a problems by looking at different angles.  
            UBC gave me opportunities to develop as an adult, demonstrated what I could accomplish and allowed me to develop my interests in my education. 
            I can’t wait to continue through my undergraduate degree, and to see where this knowledge takes me next.

          <h3>First Robotics Competition</h3>
          <h4>
          Co-Captain, from September 2015 to May 2018
          <br>
          Singapore, Singapore</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            While attending the Singapore American School in Singapore, Singapore, I got to lead my robotics team as one of the Co-Captains in my grade 12 year. 
            During my time on the team, I got to learn critical lessons about teamwork and various components of building a robot. 
            From the hard work the team put into the project, the robot we developed completed all necessary tasks at the FIRST Robotics Competition. 
            This opportunity allowed me to develop my leadership skills and technical skills, while teaching and guiding others on the team, which has been extremely valuable in succeeding projects.
