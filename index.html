        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am a second year computer engineering student at University of British Columbia (UBC). I am constantly programming and always eager to learn more.
        I love working in a team as you get to learn 
        from different perspectives, and come to a solution much faster. This year I am looking for a Co-op four month postion starting in May 2020.
        I am interested working in any field related in computer engineering. Some of my skills Java, Verilog, HTML, CSS, and I am currently working on learning C++.

            While working at Wize Inc, an online exam and tutoring company, I developed my problem solving and customer service skills. 
            As a content creator, I developed mock midterm university exams. 
            By working backwards and identifying common customer mistakes, I developed new final exam questions. 
            The new questions helped customers to learn key concepts and avoid mistakes to improve exam results.

          <p>
            For the past two years, I was fortunate to be working on the UBC Sailbot engineering design team building an autonomous sailboat. 
            Our goal is to compete in the Vic-Maui Race, sailing from Victoria, Canada to Maui, Hawaii. My team was worked on the boom positioning sensor.
            I designed the case for the sensor making sure it could survive the pacfic.
            While I am responsible for the boom positioning sensor, I have consistently volunteered to build the hull to ensure our boat is ready for the race.

          <h3>Graph and Kamino Game Project</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            During my last term at university, a partner and I programmed a Graph Abstract Data Type (ADT) in Java. 
            In our Graph ADT, we programmed several operations to create the graph including: adding or removing vertexes and adding or removing edges between vertexes. 
            Next, using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, I programmed a function to find the shortest path from one vertex to another. 
            After programming each operation, I extensively tested the code in Junit. 
            I tested every possible case to ensure 100% branch and line coverage.

          <h3>Readuce Instruction Set Chip Design Project</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            During my last term at university, a partner and I created a Readuce Instruction Set Chip (RISC) in verilog.
            In our RISC, we used a state machine to read instructions from a read-write memory block and execute the instructions.
            The instructions our RISC machine could execute was Moving numbers into registers, Adding Numbers, Subtracting Numbers, Comparing two numbers,
            loading values from memory, storing values into memory,and many types of branch operations.
            Ontop of coding we tested all of the operations and our code in testbenches.

          <p>
          University of British Columbia (UBC) gave me access to something no other oppurtunity had ever given me before, a fresh start.
          For the two years I have been at UBC I have had access to amazing professors that challenged me and expaneded my world view ultimatly pushing me into computer engineering.
          My time with <a href="https://www.ubcsailbot.org/">UBC sailbot</a>  showed me the power of working in a team, the importance of good leadership, and how important it is to solve a problem from many different angles.
